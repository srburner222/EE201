## Academia
I am a 3rd year student in ECE and am focusing in VLSI and computer architecture.
I am part of Formula One, which is a club that builds a 3/4 scale, fully electric, Formula racecar. Within the club, I am on the electronics team. Our job is to design all the circuit boards for the car. We are in charge of the car's battery system, gathering telemetry from the car, and creating the car's wiring harness. I specifically work on a PCB that gathers telemetry data from all of the car's sensors, which are analog, and digitizing the data so that we have a constant feed of data from the car.

## Outside of School
Apart from school, I spend my time split between working in a restaurant, hanging with friends, and snowboarding. I work in the kitchen of a restaurant a few days a week and do it for some extra money. More recently, I've been learning how to snowboard. Since I am not from a place that gets a lot of snow, I had never done any snow sports before. But, since most of my friends have grown up in Washington, they all have skiing or snowboarding experience and wanted to bring me with them. So, I decided to pick up snowboarding and have loved it.
